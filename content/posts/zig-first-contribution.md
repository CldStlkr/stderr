I recently made my first contribution to the Zig programming language by implementing
`insque()` and `remque()` - two doubly-linked list functions from the C standard
library.

## What are insque and remque?

These are classic C functions for manipulating doubly-linked lists...

## The Journey

### Initial Setup

Getting started was trickier than expected...

### The Implementation

[Talk about translating from C to Zig, understanding the Node struct, etc.]

### Build Issues

[The fun parts - version mismatches, merge conflicts, CI failures]

## What I Learned

- How Zig's build system works
- The importance of reading existing code patterns
- [etc.]
